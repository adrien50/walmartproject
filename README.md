We have been provided with historical sales Data of 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments and we have to project the sales for each department in each store.

To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.
