# FORECASTING of WALMART SALES using MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS 
## Problem statement
Every Departmental store chain like Walmart wants to predict the store sales in the nearby future so that inventory planning can be done. Along with that, sales prediction helps to increase/decrease store staff based on the rush (More sales can mean more customers are coming to the stores). Also, it is always a good idea to do sales and revenue forecasting to better understand the company's cash-flows and overall growth. For inventory planning, you also need to know what products (or category of products aka department) will be utilised more. Under-stock some products and your sales are hit. Over-stock items like perishables and you run into losses if the product expires. That's why the sales prediction is done at a combination of store and department level (and sometimes even at product level for high-selling products).

In this problem, we have been given the sales data of 45 stores based on store, department and week. The size and type of each store has been provided. Holiday weeks have been marked. Along with these, price markdown data (almost like discount data) has been given. A few macro-indicators like CPI, Unemployment rate, Fuel price etc. are also provided.

## Project flow

* Perform basic EDA to familiarize with the data
* Do in-depth analysis on the impact of Date/Week on sales
* Perform Bi-variate analysis to identify redundant variables
* Create new features that might add value to the model
* Plot Trend of each predictor with the target variable
* Create time series ARIMA models
* Make prediction using statistical techniques
* Make model using machine learning techniques
* Perform Hyper-parameter tuning to get the best parameters
* Perform Model Comparison
## Result
Macro Economic Indicators did not help in prediction of weekly sales. The sales data is very similar over different years 
and this consistency helped to predict the sales.
